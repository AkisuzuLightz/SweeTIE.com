# SweeTIE.com
## A warm home for sweet girls.
SweeTIE.com is a community website developed in HTML5 and CSS3.
It begins to be a sample for my personal Front-end develop practice.
And will be a center for sweet girls to publish any things in the predictable future.
So every edits from every one is welcomed. (But not means to be accepted definitely)
